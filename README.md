## Background

I originally thought of this idea when trying to find a Python IDE online that allowed
sharing of code revisions, but couldn't find one that didn't require signing up. I also needed
a playground to try out tech stacks I want more experience with.

## Running Locally

First start the backend from the backend directory:

`cd backend && npm run start`

Now go back to the root level and do the same with the client code:

`cd client && npm run start`
