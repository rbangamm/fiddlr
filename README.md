## Background

I originally thought of this idea when trying to find a Python IDE online that allowed for
sharing and updating code revisions, but couldn't find one that didn't require signing up. I also needed
a playground to try out tech stacks I want more experience with.

## Running Locally

First make sure there is a MongoDB instance running and then start the backend from the backend directory:

`cd backend && npm run start`

Now go back to the root level and run the following:

```
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```
